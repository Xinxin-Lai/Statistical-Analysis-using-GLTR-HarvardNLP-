**Giant Language model Test Room**
**Installing GLTR**
before we can use GLTR, we need to install it on our system. Start by cloning the GitHub Repository of the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/HendrikStrobelt/detecting-fake-text.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, cd into it and do pip install:
```
cd detecting-fake-text
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, download the pre-trained language model. You can do it by running the server:
```
python server.py
```

GLTR currently supports two models â€“ BERT and GPT-2. You can choose between the two; if no option is given then GPT-2 is used:
```
python server.py --model BERT
```

This will start downloading the respective pre-trained model on your machine. Give it some time if you have a slow internet connection.
When everything is ready, the server will start at port 5001 and you can directly go to http://localhost:5001 to access it:
